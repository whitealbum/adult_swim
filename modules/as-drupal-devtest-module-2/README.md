Adult Swim Developer Assessment
===

Hey again! Congratulations on getting through to the second step. Today we'd like to further explore your ability to create and to assess your ability to triage a problem.

(Another) Module

There's a lot of automation that drive's our content workflow. Videos and information related to videos being sent all over the place, finally landing on the Adult Swim website (and hopefully letting folks watch those videos).

One of the things we take advantage of are API services. We have taken the liberty of crafting a small API service that serves a series of video ID's ad names. We'd like for you to craft another module that consumes this API and renders a page with all of those videos on it.

**HINT:** The Video ID's / File names are YouTube content ID's, so be mindful of that when you're working on a solution.

Triage

Days where things work perfectly are great, but sometimes we have to deal with things that are broken (and usually at the worst possible time!).
